Hi! I am an assistant professor on Cyberspace Security at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

## Research Interest

My research interests include security problems in networks and large-scale networked systems. With behavioral analysis, machine learning and graph embedding methodologies, we can build more secure networked systems by: 

* analyzing the effects of new attack vectors such as Internet routing attacks
* enabling the network to detect and mitigate obfuscated attacks and insider attacks instead of relying on perimeter-based and signature-based protection
